          <b>Responsible Gambling</b>

          <br/>
          At NairaBoom, we are dedicated to promoting Responsible Gambling. Our goal is to ensure that gaming remains an enjoyable and leisure activity, providing a positive gaming experience for everyone involved. While most players find entertainment in our services, we recognize that for some, gaming can become problematic. To address this, NairaBoom has implemented several measures to encourage responsible gambling, allowing customers to manage their spending and stay in control.
          
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Stay in Control, It’s Only a Game</b>
          
          <br/>
          We believe gaming should always be fun and entertaining. To help you keep control and ensure gaming remains a harmless activity, consider the following tips:
          
          <br/><br/>
          1. Only stake amounts you can afford to lose.<br/>
          2. View gambling as entertainment, not a way to make money.<br/>
          3. Stake responsibly and avoid chasing losses.<br/>
          4. Monitor the time and money you spend on gaming.<br/>
          5. Balance gambling with other activities. If gaming is your sole entertainment, reassess whether you're still enjoying it.<br/>
          6. Take regular breaks from gambling. Use our self-exclusion option, and our staff will confirm your decision.<br/>
          7. Avoid gambling when influenced by alcohol or when feeling upset.

          <br/><br/>
