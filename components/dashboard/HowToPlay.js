          </Text>
          <br/>
          You can turn your everyday bank alerts into value by swapping them on NairaBoom.<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>How To Swap Your Alert:</b>
          <br/> <br/> 
          1. <b>Sign Up:</b> Create your account. <br/>
          2. <b>Log In:</b> Access your dashboard by logging in.<br/>
          3. <b>Make a Deposit:</b> Fund your wallet with the minimum deposit. <br/>
          4. <b>Swap Your Alert:</b> Click any of the ‚ÄúSWAP NOW‚Äù or ‚ÄúPLAY NOW‚Äù options on your dashboard 
          &#127918; , input the details of any recent bank alert (credit or debit alert) you received and 
          tap on the "Rollover to Swap" button for a chance to cashout üé∞!
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <b>How to Cashout from Swapping your Bank Alerts:</b>
          <br/> <br/> 
          1. <b>Cashout Keys:</b> Match the Cashout Keys üîë in the exact order as seen on your dashboard 
          in one spin cycle to win a percentage of your Boom Coin Tokens (BCT) as cash. <br/>
          2. <b>3 Green Balls :</b> Win your accumulated Boom Coin Tokens (BCT) as cash when you get 
          3 green balls in one spin cycle üíµ.<br/>
          3. <b>4 Green Balls :</b> Hit the Jackpot üéâ when you get 4 green balls in one spin cycle during 
          the jackpot week!

            II. 3 SURE CASHOUT
          </Text>
          <br/> 
          Boost your cashout chances with 3 Sure Cashout which offers a cumulative win across three consecutive 
          rollovers (alert swaps), ensuring higher odds of cashing outüí∏ !
          <br/>
          <br />
          <b>How It Works:</b>
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Rollover 1:</b> Swap an alert and if you get 1 or 2 green balls in one spin cycle, you receive the 
          first tick ‚úÖin your 3 Sure Cashout Tracker.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Rollover 2:</b> Swap an alert the second time and if you get 1 or 2 green balls in one spin cycle, 
          you receive the second tick ‚úÖin your 3 Sure Cashout Tracker.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Rollover 3:</b> Swap an alert for the third time and if you get 1 or 2 green balls in one spin cycle, 
          you receive the third tick ‚úÖin your 3 Sure Cashout Tracker.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Cashout:</b> Once you complete three (3) green ticks ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖ in 3 consecutive rollovers (alert swaps), 
          you win a cumulative percentage amount from the 3 rollovers (alert swaps) you just did üí∏.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Note:</b> If you do not get a Green Ball in Rollover 2, you immediately get another chance to perform 
          Rollover 2 again before proceeding to Rollover 3.

          <br/> 
          Unlock the power of NairaBoom's Monetization Program and earn lifetime commissions by growing the NairaBoom community.
          <br/><br/>
          <Text fontWeight={700}>How It Works:</Text>
          <br/> 
          1. <b>Grow Your Trybe:</b> Share your unique referral link and earn ‚Ç¶100.000 for every successful referral when 
          they complete their first rollover (alert swap). Once you hit the required referral count (minimum of 5 referrals), 
          your Monetization Status will be unlocked, opening the door to even more earnings. <br/><br/> 
          2. <b>Earn Big:</b> After activation of your monetization status, you will start earning up to 40% on all swap fares 
          and cashouts from your Trybe.<br/><br/> 
          3. <b>Lifetime Earnings:</b> With no cap on referrals or earnings, you can keep growing your Trybe and boost your income for life.
          <br/><br/>
          <Text fontWeight={700}>Steps to Grow Your Trybe & Earn:</Text>
          <br/> 
          1. <b>Access Your Referral Link:</b> Head to your dashboard menu and tap on <b>'Refer Your Trybe'</b> to find your unique referral 
          link. <br/><br/> 
          2. <b>Share Your Referral Link:</b> Click "Share My Link To Refer" and send it to your contacts via social media or by copying 
          and pasting your link directly.<br/><br/> 
          3. <b>Expand Your Trybe:</b> There‚Äôs no cap on the number of referrals or your potential earnings because the more people you refer 
          to join your Trybe, the more you earn on the platform.
          <br/><br/> 
          4. <b>Earn for Life:</b> Get up to 40% on swap fares and cashouts of your Trybe credited to your wallet, which you can withdraw to 
          your bank account anytime.
          <br/><br/> 
          <Text fontWeight={700}>Multi-Level Trybe Earnings:</Text>
          <br/> 
          Your earnings go beyond your direct referrals in your Trybe. When your referrals bring in their own referrals, you continue earning 
          across three levels of referrals. This means your income grows not only from your direct referrals but also from those they bring 
          into NairaBoom. The bigger your ‚ÄúTrybe‚Äù, the more you earn!<br/>
          <br/>
          <b>Monetization Earnings Breakdown:</b>
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Referral Level 1:</b> Earn up to 10% on swap fares and 10% on cashouts from your direct referrals in your Trybe.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Referral Level 2:</b> Earn up to 5% on swap fares and 7.5% on cashouts from your direct referrals' Trybe.
          <br/><br/>
          <b>Referral Level 3:</b> Earn up to 2.5% on swap fares and 5% on cashouts from your indirect referrals Trybe.
